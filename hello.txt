Hello, my name is Gabriella. I'm 30 years old and currently based in Lausanne. I studied at HEC Lausanne and have basic knowledge of data analytics and coding.
Along my career, data analysis has been integral to measuring success, optimizing processes and extracting valuable information. Through this course, I hope to gain hands-on knowledge on how machine learning works to be able to lead projects in this area, in business contexts.
